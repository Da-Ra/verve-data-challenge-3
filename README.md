# Advertiser Recommendation Spark Project

This is a Spark project that recommends the top 5 advertisers for each combination of app and country based on the average revenue per impression. The project uses Scala and Spark SQL.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two Scala files and a build file:
- AdvertiserRecommendation.scala: the main file that contains the code for loading the data, joining the impressions and clicks data, grouping the data by app, country and advertiser, getting the top 5 advertisers and writing the output to a JSON file.
- build.sbt: the build file that specifies the name of the project, its version, the Scala version and the dependencies on Spark Core and Spark SQL.

The project also includes two input files and an output directory:
- impressions.json: a JSON file that contains the impressions data.
- clicks.json: a JSON file that contains the clicks data.
- outputs/: a directory that contains the output JSON file generated by the project.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, you need to have sbt and Spark installed and set up on your machine. You can follow the instructions on the [sbt website](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) and the [Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) to install and set up sbt and Spark.

Once sbt and Spark are installed, you can run the project by executing the following command in the project directory:

```shell
sbt compile
sbt run
```
